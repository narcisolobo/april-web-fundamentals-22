    <h1>Intro to the DOM</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Document Object Model - <em>The document (window) modeled as a JavaScript object.</em></p>

    <h3>What is a JavaScript object?</h3>
    <p>IRL, objects have characteristics and things they can do. For example, a car has a color, a number of wheels, a make, a model, etc. These are the characteristics of a car. Also, a car can drive, it can beep, etc. These are things a car can do.</p>
    <p>In JS, characteristics are properties. Things that objects can do are called methods.</p>
    <pre>
        // Object Literal Notation
        // Creating an object in JavaScript

        var car = {
            "color": "red",
            "numWheels": 4,
            "make": "Jeep",
            "model": "Wrangler",
            "drive": function () {
                console.log("Car is driving...")
            }
        }

        // getting and setting values in an object
        // Two options: bracket notation, and dot notation

        console.log(car.color)
        car.color = "blue";
        console.log(car.color);

        console.log(car["color"]);
        car["color"] = "red";
        console.log(car["color"]);

        car.drive();
